                <p>             
                Our project is an embedded system designed to help tackle noise pollution in Longford and other local areas. It uses a built-in microphone on a microbit to measure noise levels in decibels (dB), the standard unit for sound. The device records ambient noise from sources like traffic, construction, and industry, providing real-time data.
                The collected data is processed and stored, allowing users to view it in simple graphs and charts. This helps track noise trends, identify peak noise times, and understand how different sources contribute to noise pollution.

            <h3 id="heading2">Why is it important?</h3>
            <p>This is important because it provides valuable information on areas that may exceed noise pollution.
                It is also especially important in planning for building residential sectors and monitoring noise pollution can be a major factor in whether the construction can go ahead.
                Things like hotel and housing estates all benefit from the surrounding area being quiet. </p>

                <h3 id="heading3">How do we collect data?</h3>
                <p>Data we collect from the microbit is stored on the device's flash storage, allowing it to securely save recorded information. This data is later downloaded in CSV format, making it easy to transfer into Excel for detailed analysis. Within Excel, the data is processed and visualized in the form of a graph, which highlights trends and patterns. The graph serves as a critical tool for identifying and analyzing the peak times of noise pollution in the monitored area, offering insights that could inform further actions or studies.</p>

                <p>Our device is a simple, it is a microbit that uses its onboard microphone to collect sound levels. It does this by running code that keeps it looped and logs sound levels every 10 seconds.</p>
